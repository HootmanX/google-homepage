README file created for the first project

Listing things I have learned in this assignment.

* setting up github 
* creating new github repository 
* cloneing repository 
* staging and pushing updates 

Worked through the project with minimal html and NO css experience.

A lot of Googling and adjusting.

The end product "resembles" Google's homepage, however, I will admit that the code is all over the place.

Leaves plenty of things to refine on my next projects/attempts.
